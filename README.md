## Description
For this Week 10 Challenge we were tasked with creating a SVG Logo generator with node.js that we can save as an SVG file! 

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/svg-logo-maker to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
To use this project, please make sure you have inquirer installed. You can do that by running the command `npm i`. Once that is installed, the user can run invoke it via the gitbash terminal by typing `node index.js` . The user will then be prompted with questions that make a high quality SVG file. The questions are `Please enter up to 3 characters to display for your SVG logo` , `Please enter a text color to display by providing a color keyword OR a hexadecimal number` , `Please choose the shape to display for your SVG Logo (Use arrow keys)` , and `Please enter a shape color to display by providing a color keyword OR a hexadecimal number`. Once all questions are answered, the SVG file is generated for the user in the main develop folder.
