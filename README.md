## Description
For this Week 10 Challenge we were tasked with creating a SVG Logo generator with node.js that we can save as an SVG file!

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/svg-logo-maker to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
To use this project, please make sure you have inquirer installed. Once that is installed, the user can run invoke it via the gitbash terminal by node index.js . The user will then be prompted with questions that make a high quality SVG file. Once all questions are answered, the SVG file is generated for the user in the main develop folder.
